            <p>&ldquo;When urban migration increases, cities tend to sprawl outwards,&rdquo; explains Sabah Barakat, acting CEO of the PIF-owned New Murabba Development Company (NMDC), which is in charge of a huge downtown area to be developed in Riyadh. &ldquo;This pushes residential areas further away from the jobs and services in the city centre, which then creates congestion as more people need to travel in and out.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>To alleviate this congestion, PIF is investing in vast urban developments to create societies where people can live, work and play without travelling – in the case of the expansive KAFD – more than 10 minutes from their home.</p>

              <p>Many of the solutions exist in the natural environment, and technology is helping many PIF companies determine how cities can make better use of the world around them. Planting more vegetation in the Wadi river basin, for example, could increase wind flow into Riyadh and lower temperatures naturally by as much as 5C. KAFD has also been designed in consideration of its surroundings, with a central pedestrian walkway connecting all areas, which was constructed below street level to capture wind flow, and ensure that temperatures are 8-10C cooler than central Riyadh.</p>
              <p>Yet planting too much greenery in a very low humidity environment can put the water system under greater strain. Sensors and artificial intelligence are essential to determining where vegetation will be effective without being resource intensive.</p>

              <p>Smart planning is also evident at the integrated communities built by ROSHN, the PIF giga-project developing more than 400,000 homes throughout a number of Saudi Arabian cities by 2030. Developments by ROSHN, which is led by CEO David Grover, include residential units with high-tech insulation, solar-powered water heaters, and efficient air-conditioning systems – all surrounded by public spaces, green areas, and cycle pathways to promote a healthy lifestyle and walkable environment.</p>

              <p>These smarter models for urban design underpin PIF’s blueprint for the future of cities, but they do not define them. &ldquo;We are very conscious of Saudi culture and heritage, and the way architecture varies around the kingdom,&rdquo; explains Grover. &ldquo;This means that while houses need to be high quality, they also need to be placed in a visual wrapper that fits in with the local architecture and the local community.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>The difference in architectural style between Jeddah and Riyadh, for example, reflects the different environmental and cultural conditions. &ldquo;Everything from window height and style to the colour palette defines the architecture,&rdquo; says Grover.</p>
