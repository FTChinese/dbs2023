            <p>About 20km west from the centre of Riyadh, work is well underway on PIF’s ambitious project to turn Diriyah, the historic birthplace of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, into one of the world’s key culture and lifestyle destinations. The development is being built entirely in the Najdi architectural style – the distinctive Saudi building aesthetic, set around a courtyard – and will make use of locally sourced materials, including traditionally made mud bricks and limestone. The Diriyah area includes the Unesco World Heritage Site of At-Turaif, and reflects a journey that spans nearly 300 years of Saudi history. Having opened the doors on its first destinations at the end of 2022, Diriyah welcomed 1 mn guests in the first six months of operations.</p>

The regenerative-tourism destination stretches across 200km of coastline, encompassing more than 90 islands as well as the Al Wajh lagoon, a unique ecological habitat centred around coral reefs, seagrass and mangrove trees.</p>
              <p>Preserving this natural habitat is a core mission, and Red Sea Global, the firm behind the project, is committed to achieving a 30 per cent net conservation benefit by 2040 at The Red Sea and its sister destination Amaala.</p>

              <p>Lars Clasen, CEO of the PIF-owned Cruise Saudi, believes that authenticity is a vital quality in any tourism business, not only in providing an immersive experience for guests but also facilitating operations. &ldquo;Saudi Arabia’s rich culture is what attracts international tourists to its shores, and to date Cruise Saudi has welcomed more than 300,000 passengers representing over 120 nationalities. However, this means that there is a wide variety of different cultures and expectations – with different food preferences, music tastes and even different timings in daily schedules. Offering an experience that is authentically Saudi therefore aligns our passengers in a shared experience.&rdquo;</p>

              <p>Sustainability is also core to the futuristic visions of tourism underway at NEOM, one of PIF’s five giga-projects. The flagship regions of the development taking shape in north-west Saudi Arabia include a luxury island, Sindalah, and Trojena, NEOM’s year-round mountain destination and the first outdoor ski experience in the region.</p>
              <p>Epicon, located on the Gulf of Aqaba, is NEOM’s latest luxury coastal tourism destination. Rising from the desert landscape like a glistening mirage, the project will feature two striking towers, one 225 metres tall and one reaching 275 metres, home to an ultra-premium hotel and luxury residences.</p>
              <p>NEOM tourism destination Leyja, announced in October, is further enriching Saudi Arabia’s ecotourism offering. The development, comprising three hotels, starts from the Gulf of Aqaba coast in the west, then winds inland to form a natural valley carved between 400m-high mountains. Of Leyja’s total area, 95 per cent will be preserved for nature and will combine innovative, ecological design and construction techniques.</p>
